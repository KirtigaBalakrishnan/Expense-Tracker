In current situation it is very necessary to manage the expense especially to reduce our credit card bills. 
I am designing an application to track daily expense and find if the user is spending more than required in a particular category.
The application will help the user to store daily expenses and itâ€™s categories and it sums up all the values entered by the user according to the date. 
A bar graph will be generated based on the categories. The graph helps the user to check if the user has to reduce any unnecessary expense on a particular category.
